# Finally, a WIP

I finally got to building my portfolio project after months of feeling I was not ready and it needed to be a perfect portfolio. To be honest, one can never be fully ready in this industry as I have found out, so just start, which is what I am doing now. So I will start anyway, although not perfect, and continue with it as I go along, adding features and refactoring.
