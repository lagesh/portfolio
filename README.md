### Introduction

I finally got to building my portfolio project after months of feeling I was not ready and it needed to be a perfect portfolio. To be honest, one can never be fully ready in this industry as I have found out, so just start from where you are, and learn, build, iterate, and refactor as you go along, which is what I am doing now. So I will start anyway, although not perfect, and continue with it as I go along.

### Web Link

_The online link to this project is [here](https://lagesh.github.io/portfolio)_

### Tech Stack

I am building this website initially with pure html, CSS, and JavaScript (which I seem to be getting much better at). I may use JQuery for some interactive functions, and plan is to rebuild the whole site using React when I learn it.

### Notice

This site is far from finished yet. I needed to push it online to get myself out there, while not necessarily waiting for all lights to be green and use the pressure as additional motivation.
